    Generate synthetic data for a credit card dataset. Here is the context about the dataset:

    Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
    Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations. Past models may lose their original predictive power. Logistic model is a common method for credit scoring. Because Logistic is suitable for binary classification tasks and can calculate the coefficients of each feature. In order to facilitate understanding and operation, the score card will multiply the logistic regression coefficient by a certain value (such as 100) and round it.
    At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. However, these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance.


    The dataset consists of two tables: `User Records` and `Credit Records`, merged by `ID`. The output must create field values with the following specifications:

    User Records Fields (static per user):
    - ID: Unique client number (e.g., 100001, 100002).
    - CODE_GENDER: Gender ('F' or 'M').
    - FLAG_OWN_CAR: Car ownership ('Y' or 'N').
    - FLAG_OWN_REALTY: Property ownership ('Y' or 'N').
    - CNT_CHILDREN`: Number of children (0 or more).
    - AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`: Annual income.
    - NAME_INCOME_TYPE`: Income category (e.g., 'Commercial associate', 'State servant').
    - NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE`: Education level (e.g., 'Higher education', 'Secondary').
    - NAME_FAMILY_STATUS`: Marital status (e.g., 'Married', 'Single').
    - NAME_HOUSING_TYPE`: Way of living. 
    - DAYS_BIRTH`: Birthday	Count backwards from current day (0), -1 means yesterday.
    - DAYS_EMPLOYED: Start date of employment	Count backwards from current day(0). If positive, it means the person currently unemployed. (negative for employed; positive for unemployed).
    - FLAG_MOBIL: Is there a mobile phone ('Y'/'N')
    - FLAG_WORK_PHONE:	Is there a work phone ('Y'/'N')	
    - FLAG_PHONE: Is there a phone ('Y'/'N')
    - FLAG_EMAIL: Is there an email ('Y'/'N')	
    - OCCUPATION_TYPE: Occupation (e.g., 'Manager', 'Sales staff').
    - CNT_FAM_MEMBERS: Family size (1 or more).

    Credit records Fields (nested array):
    - ID: needs to be the same as the User Records Fields ID.
    - MONTHS_BALANCE: Refers to Record month.	The month of the extracted data is the starting point, backwards, 0 is the current month, -1 is the previous month, and so on.
    - STATUS: 
        Must be one of ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'C', 'X'].
        Values description:	0: 1-29 days past due 1: 30-59 days past due 2: 60-89 days overdue 3: 90-119 days overdue 4: 120-149 days overdue 5: Overdue or bad debts, write-offs for more than 150 days C: paid off that month X: No loan for the month
        

    3. Requirements:
    - Consistency: Ensure `ID` consistency between the application and its nested credit records.
    - Avoid real personal data (use synthetic values).
    - Format output as three separate JSON objects, each with the structure shown in the examples.

    When generating the data, make sure to adhere to the following guidelines:

    Privacy guidelines:
    - Avoid real PII.
    - Ensure examples are not leaked into the synthetic data

    Cross-row entries guidelines (applies to Credit Records):
    - Entries must be ordered from oldest (`MONTHS_BALANCE=-60`) to newest (`MONTHS_BALANCE=0`).  
    - No duplicate `MONTHS_BALANCE` values for a single client.
    - The time-series credit record entries need to be logical and consistent when read in the correct sequence.
    - Ensure there are no other cross-row Credit Records inconsistencies not listed above. 

    Formatting guidelines:
    - `CNT_CHILDREN`, `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`, `DAYS_BIRTH`, `DAYS_EMPLOYED`, etc., must be integers.  
    - `MONTHS_BALANCE` must be an integer 0 or less.
    - Ensure no other formatting problems or inconsistencies appear that are not listed above. 

    Cross-row entries guidelines (applies to Credit Records):
    - Entries must be ordered from oldest (`MONTHS_BALANCE=-60`) to newest (`MONTHS_BALANCE=0`).  
    - No duplicate `MONTHS_BALANCE` values for a single client.
    - If a Recent `MONTHS_BALANCE` is 0 there  should be an "X" (no loan) or "C" (paid off).  
    - The time-series credit record entries need to be logical and consistent when read in the correct sequence. (e.g. delinquencies can appear in progression as "0" → "1" → "2" as months progress from  "-2" → "-1" → "0"  etc).  
    - Ensure there are no other Credit Records inconsistencies appear that not listed above.


    Cross-Column guidelines:  
    - Check cross-column inconsistencies such as:
        If `FLAG_OWN_REALTY="Y"`, `NAME_HOUSING_TYPE` must **not** be "Rented apartment".  
        If `DAYS_EMPLOYED > 0` (unemployed), `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` should be lower (e.g., ≤ $50,000).  
        `OCCUPATION_TYPE` must align with `NAME_INCOME_TYPE` (e.g., "Pensioner" cannot have "Manager" as occupation).  
        `CNT_FAM_MEMBERS` ≥ `CNT_CHILDREN` + 1 (accounting for at least one parent).  
    - Ensure there are no other cross-field Credit Records inconsistencies appear that are not listed above.

            - No inconsistencies detected. (No deductions).  
            4. Background Knowledge/Realism:  
            - Interest rates (12–18.5%) align with real-world lending practices at the issuance date.  
            - Loan terms (36/60 months), employment lengths (0–10 years), and DTI ratios (15–25%) are realistic. (No deductions).

        In addition to the definitions above, when evaluating the data samples, make sure the data adhere to following guidelines:

        Privacy Compliance guidelines:
        1) Allow PII reducted addresses to ensure privacy is maintained. Also, ensure the records address's zipcode and state match the given values in the seed instructions.

        Formatting guidelines:
        1) Check for consistent decimal precision.  
        2) Ensure dates (e.g. issue_d, earliest_cr_line) follow the "Jan-YYYY" format.
        3) Validate that term has space before the number of months (i.e. " 36 months")
        4) State zipcode needs to be exactly as specified in the seed instructions. The persons address must follow the format as specified in the examples with the State zipcode coming last.
        5) Any other formatting guidelines that can be inferred from the examples or field definitions but are not listed above.

        Cross-column guidelines:
        1) Check for logical and realistic consistency and correlations between variables. Examples include but not limited to:
        a) Grade/Sub-grade consistency: Sub-grade must match the grade (e.g., "B" grade → "B1" to "B5" possible subgrades).  
        b) Interest Rate vs Grade/Subgrade relationship: Higher subgrades (e.g., A5) could have higher `int_rate` than lower subgrades (e.g., A3).  
        c) Mortgage Consistency: `mort_acc` should be 1 or more if `home_ownership` is `MORTGAGE`. 
        d) Open Accounts: `open_acc` ≤ `total_acc`.  
        Note: Do not deduct point points based on the installment amount and its relationship with interest rate, loan amount, and term. The relationship has already been verified.

        Data distribution guidelines:
        1) Check if the generated values are statistically possible and within any ranges given the parameters defined in the seed instructions. 

        Background knowledge and realism guidelines:
        1) Ensure fields such as interest rates reflect real-world interest rates at the time the loan is issued.
        2) Check all generated values if they are plausible given real-world background information.



        Scoring Workflow: 
        1. Start at 10 points and deduct points for each violation:  
        - Privacy Compliance: -1 points for any violations related to privacy guidelines.
        - Formatting: -1 point for any violations related to formatting inconsistencies.  
        - Cross-column: -4 points for any violations related to Cross-column inconsistencies.  
        - Background knowledge and realism: -1 point for any violations related to Background knowledge and realism inconsistencies. 
            Note: Allow made-up PII information without deducting points.
        - Other violations: -2 points for any other violations, inconsistencies that you detect but are not listed above.
        2. Cap score at 1 if any critical errors (e.g., PII leakage, missing fields).  
        4. Give a score rating 1-10 for the given data.  If there are more than 9 points to subtract use 1 as the absolute minimum scoring. 
        5. List all scoring justifications as list.

        Evaluate the quality of the provided synthetic credit data  and return a score between 1 and 10. The score should reflect how well the data adheres to the following criteria:  

        Here is the context about the dataset:

        Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
        Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations. Past models may lose their original predictive power. Logistic model is a common method for credit scoring. Because Logistic is suitable for binary classification tasks and can calculate the coefficients of each feature. In order to facilitate understanding and operation, the score card will multiply the logistic regression coefficient by a certain value (such as 100) and round it.
        At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. However, these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance.


        The dataset consists of two tables: `User Records` and `Credit Records`, merged by `ID`. The output must create field values with the following specifications:

        User Records Fields (static per user):
        - ID: Unique client number (e.g., 100001, 100002).
        - CODE_GENDER: Gender ('F' or 'M').
        - FLAG_OWN_CAR: Car ownership ('Y' or 'N').
        - FLAG_OWN_REALTY: Property ownership ('Y' or 'N').
        - CNT_CHILDREN`: Number of children (0 or more).
        - AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`: Annual income.
        - NAME_INCOME_TYPE`: Income category (e.g., 'Commercial associate', 'State servant').
        - NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE`: Education level (e.g., 'Higher education', 'Secondary').
        - NAME_FAMILY_STATUS`: Marital status (e.g., 'Married', 'Single').
        - NAME_HOUSING_TYPE`: Way of living. 
        - DAYS_BIRTH`: Birthday	Count backwards from current day (0), -1 means yesterday.
        - DAYS_EMPLOYED: Start date of employment	Count backwards from current day(0). If positive, it means the person currently unemployed. (negative for employed; positive for unemployed).
        - FLAG_MOBIL: Is there a mobile phone ('Y'/'N')
        - FLAG_WORK_PHONE:	Is there a work phone ('Y'/'N')	
        - FLAG_PHONE: Is there a phone ('Y'/'N')
        - FLAG_EMAIL: Is there an email ('Y'/'N')	
        - OCCUPATION_TYPE: Occupation (e.g., 'Manager', 'Sales staff').
        - CNT_FAM_MEMBERS: Family size (1 or more).

        Credit Records Fields (nested array):
        - ID: needs to be the same as the User Records Fields ID.
        - MONTHS_BALANCE: Refers to Record month.	The month of the extracted data is the starting point, backwards, 0 is the current month, -1 is the previous month, and so on.
        - STATUS: 
            Must be one of ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'C', 'X'].
            Values description:	0: 1-29 days past due 1: 30-59 days past due 2: 60-89 days overdue 3: 90-119 days overdue 4: 120-149 days overdue 5: Overdue or bad debts, write-offs for more than 150 days C: paid off that month X: No loan for the month
            

        Evaluate whether the data adhere to the following guidelines:

        Privacy guidelines:
        - Allow ficticious PII entries that do not leak PII.

        Formatting guidelines:
        - `CNT_CHILDREN`, `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`, `DAYS_BIRTH`, `DAYS_EMPLOYED`, etc., must be integers.  
        - `MONTHS_BALANCE` must be an integer 0 or less.
        - Ensure no other formatting problems or inconsistencies appear that are not listed above. 

        Cross-row entries guidelines (applies to Credit Records):
        - Entries must be ordered from oldest (e.g. `MONTHS_BALANCE=-60`) to newest (`MONTHS_BALANCE=0`).  
        - No duplicate `MONTHS_BALANCE` values for a single client.
        - Consecutive STATUS=C is allowed since it indicates that each monthly payment and amount owned is paid off.
        - The time-series credit record entries need to be logical and consistent when read in the correct sequence as months progress from negative to 0.
        - Ensure the records dont start from deliquency 2 but rather from 0, C or X.
        - Ensure there are no other Credit Records inconsistencies appear that not listed above.


        Cross-Column guidelines:  
        - Check cross-column inconsistencies such as:
            If `FLAG_OWN_REALTY="Y"`, `NAME_HOUSING_TYPE` must **not** be "Rented apartment".  
            If `DAYS_EMPLOYED > 0` (unemployed), `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` should be lower (e.g., ≤ $50,000).  
            `OCCUPATION_TYPE` must align with `NAME_INCOME_TYPE` (e.g., "Pensioner" cannot have "Manager" as occupation).  
            `CNT_FAM_MEMBERS` ≥ `CNT_CHILDREN` + 1 (accounting for at least one parent).  
            DAYS_BIRTH, DAYS_EMPLOYED, OCCUPATION_TYPE and other variables are reasonable when considered together. 
        - Ensure there are no other cross-field Credit Records inconsistencies appear that are not listed above.


        Scoring Workflow:
        Start at 10, deduct points for violations:  
        Subtract 2 points for any Privacy guidelines violations.
        Subtract 1 point for any formatting guidelines violations.
        Subtract 1 point for any cross-column violations.
        Subtract 4 points for any Cross-row guidelines guidelines violations.
        Subtract 2 points for any other problem with the generated data not listed above.
        Cap minimum score score at 1 if any critical errors (e.g., missing `ID`, PII, or invalid `STATUS`).  


        Give a score rating 1-10 for the given data.  If there are more than 9 points to subtract use 1 as the absolute minimum scoring. List all justification as list.

        In addition to the definitions above, when generating samples, adhere to following guidelines:

        Privacy Compliance guidelines:
        1) Ensure PII from examples such as addresses are not used in the generated data to minimize any privacy concerns. 
        2) Avoid real PII in addresses. Use generic street names and cities.  

        Formatting guidelines:
        1) Use consistent decimal precision (e.g., "10000.00" for loan_amnt).  
        2) Dates (e.g. issue_d, earliest_cr_line) should follow the "Jan-YYYY" format.
        3) term has a leading space before the number of months (i.e. " 36 months")
        4) The address field is a special case where the State zipcode needs to be exactly as specified in the seed instructions. 
        The persons address must follow the format as specified in the examples with the State zipcode coming last.
        5) Any other formatting guidelines that can be inferred from the examples or field definitions but are not listed above.

        Cross-row guidelines:
        1) Generated data should maintain consistency with all statistical parameters and distributions defined in the seed instruction
        across records (e.g., 60% of `term` as " 36 months").

        Cross-column guidelines:
        1) Ensure logical and realistic consistency and correlations between variables. Examples include but not limited to:
        a) Grade/Sub-grade consistency: Sub-grade must match the grade (e.g., "B" grade → "B1" to "B5").  
        b) Interest Rate vs Grade/Subgrade relationship: Higher subgrades (e.g., A5) could have higher `int_rate` than lower subgrades (e.g., A3).  
        c) Mortgage Consistency: `mort_acc` should be 1 or more if `home_ownership` is `MORTGAGE`. 
        d) Open Accounts: `open_acc` ≤ `total_acc`.  

        Data distribution guidelines:
        1) Continuous Variables (e.g., `loan_amnt`, `annual_inc`): Adhere to the mean and standard deviation given in the seed 
        instructions for each variable.
        2) Categorical variables (e.g., `term`, `home_ownership`): Use probability distributions given in the seed instructions 
        (e.g. 60% for " 36 months", 40% for " 60 months").
        3) Discrete Variables (e.g., `pub_rec`, `mort_acc`): Adhere to value ranges and statistical parameters
        provided in the seed instructions.
        4) Any other logical data distribution guidelines that can be inferred from the seed instructions or field definitions 
        and are not specified above. 

        Background knowledge and realism guidelines:
        1) Ensure fields such as interest rates reflect real-world interest rates at the time the loan is issued.
        2) Generate values that are plausible (e.g., `annual_inc` ≤ $500,000 for most `emp_length` ranges).  
        3) Avoid unrealistic values (e.g., `revol_util` as "200%" is unrealistic).  
        4) Ensure that the generated data is realistic and plausible, avoiding extreme or impossible values.
        5) Ensure that the generated data is diverse and not repetitive, avoiding identical or very similar records.
        6) Ensure that the generated data is coherent and consistent, avoiding contradictions or inconsistencies between fields.
        7) Ensure that the generated data is relevant to the LendingClub use case and adheres to the guidelines provided."""
