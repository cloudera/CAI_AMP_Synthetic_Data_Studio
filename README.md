## Features

### Data Generation
- Support for multiple fine-tuning techniques:
  - âœ… Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - Currently Live
  - ðŸš§ PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) - WIP
  - ðŸš§ ORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization) - WIP
  - ðŸš§ DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) - WIP
  - ðŸš§ KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimisation) - WIP

### Use Cases

#### Code Generation
Generate diverse programming question-answer pairs across multiple domains, complete with detailed explanations and working code examples. The system creates scenarios that test both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills, producing high-quality training data for code-assistance models.

#### Text-to-SQL
Generate data as prompt and SQL pairs on custom data schemas which can be used to further fine-tune models for enhanced text2sql performance on OSS models.

#### Custom Use Cases
Flexible framework for implementing additional use cases which allows users to create their own workflow.

### Model Integration

#### AWS Bedrock Integration
- Claude 3 Family 
- Llama 3 Models
- Mistral Models

#### Cloudera AI Inference (CAII) Support


### Evaluation
- Built-in evaluation capabilities for generated datasets
- Customizable evaluation prompts
- Scoring system with detailed justifications

### Output Modes
- Preview Mode (displayed on Front-End) for prompts solution pairs <= 25
- Batch Mode via Cloudera ML Jobs (User can run this only in Cloudera environment)

## Architecture

Built using:
- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend: React
- Database: SQLite (for metadata storage)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   # AWS Bedrock credentials (in CML environment)
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your secret key"
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="aws region"
   ```
   > Note: If using AWS Bedrock, ensure you have access to the LLM you intend to use.

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   python build_client.py
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python start_application.py
   ```
